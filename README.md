Easytimer
=========

A simple timer to remind of things at intervals. Like for example to take a break, or have some more coffee.

After reading recent articles on how sitting all day is bad for you, and that even a 5 minute standing break every hour makes a huge difference, I decided to make myself a very simple timer to remind myself to take breaks.

I am fairly certain this isn't the first of its kind, but it was an interesting project.

Hopefully it will grow over time as I add more features and tweak parts of it.

HOWTO
-----
Launch it (it's a python script) and then right click the system tray icon. Click **setup** to set your timer interval and a custom message (if you want).
Once setup, right click again and select **start** - the icon will turn green.
To stop the timer right click and select **stop**. This is not a pause and so the timer is reset when you start it again.

That's about all there is to it.
